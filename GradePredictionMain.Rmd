```{r}
# Function to find each student's average number of attempts

  # This is get the all data related to the current student

  # This is get the all data related to the current student
  first_half_data <- filter(early_dataset, SubjectID == student_instance) # All of this student's problem entries from the the early part of the semester
  
  # find percent of time student gets the right answer eventually
  PerCorrectEventually <- mean(first_half_data$CorrectEventually) # Average number correct for all of this student's problems that are attempted

Feature Extraction on the training data
</p>

```{r}
# Add a column with each student's average number of events

names(agg_train_id_grade_data)[names(agg_train_id_grade_data) == "SubjectID"] <- "id"

```



```{r}
# Linear models

# Avg_attempts vs. final grade
model1 <- lm(avg_attempts~grade, data=agg_train_id_grade_data)

#Percent eventually correct vs. final grade
model2 <- lm(per_CorrectEventually~grade, data = agg_train_id_grade_data)

# Percent eventually correct AND average attempts vs. final grade
model3 <- lm(grade~avg_attempts+per_CorrectEventually, data=agg_train_id_grade_data)
